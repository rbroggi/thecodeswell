Hey there, I'm Rodrigo, Broggi, or Rod if you're up for good vibes! I'm a Software Engineer with over a decade of experience, and let me tell you, it's been a fun ride. I genuinely enjoy being part of a team – in my book, collaboration is key (and makes the coding journey way more enjoyable!).

When it comes to tech, I've spent a good chunk of time in the Kubernetes world, especially deploying Go microservices. There's something satisfying about seeing those little containers orchestrate themselves perfectly! My journey in software has taken me through a diverse range of industries, from the fast-paced world of ride-hailing to the intricate systems of finance (risk management, to be precise!), the complexities of the air industry (specifically in GDS – global distribution systems), the cutting-edge realm of blockchain and crypto, and even the smooth streams of the streaming world. This variety has given me some pretty interesting perspectives, which I like to bring to the table.

Speaking of perspectives, my background in mathematical engineering has always been a secret weapon (well, not so secret anymore!). It's helped me approach problems with a unique angle and bring a data-oriented mindset to the software teams I've been a part of.

When I'm not immersed in code, you can probably find me catching some waves – I'm a keen surfer. And when I'm back on dry land, I love to unwind by playing some Brazilian guitar. It's a great way to de-stress after a day of tackling tech challenges.
